# raspberry pi router
 A working documentation, notes, and collection of resources on setting up a raspberry pi as a router

# goal

The goal of this project is to set up a raspberry pi and use it as a home router. If I can run all the routing functionalities on a docker container, that is even better.

If the latter is possible, I also hope to add the following features
- VPN (wiredguard, openvpn)
- Adblocking (pi-hole)
